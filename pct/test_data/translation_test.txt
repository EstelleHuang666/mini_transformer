It is commonly believed in United States that school is where people go to get an education.
Nevertheless, it has been said that today children interrupt their education to go to school.
The distinction between schooling and education implied by this remark is important.
Education is much more open-ended and all-inclusive than schooling.
Education knows no bounds.
It can take place anywhere, whether in the shower or in the job, whether in a kitchen or on a tractor.
