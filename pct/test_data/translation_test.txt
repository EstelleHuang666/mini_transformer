The former residence of John Strauss is situated on a big street, inside an old pink-colored four-story apartment building along the street.
Strauss lived in two suites on the second floor of this building in which he composed from the end of 1866 to the beginning of 1867 the famous The Blue Danube Waltz.
At that time he was already 42 years old and enjoyed a high reputation within the musical circle of Vienna.
However, it was not until the composition of this melody that he became firmly established as the King of Waltz.
The house in which he lived was not far away from the Danube River, which was within the reach of half an hour's walk.
At that time, there was a huge forest between the river and his house and Strauss would frequently go through the forest to have a walk by the side of the river.
Now the forest has been replaced by rows and rows of densely adjacent houses and buildings, turning the place into noisy streets.
